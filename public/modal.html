    <h2>Setting up Streak</h2>
        <p>
            To set up habit tracking, simply press the <b>Save</b> button on the settings pop-up.
            Mark off the days that you have completed the the streak on the calendar, and the front of the Trello card will track your progress. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Streak will show a <b>yellow</b> background if you are in danger of losing your streak today, and <b>green</b> if you have an ongoing streak.
        </p>

    <h2> Streak Settings</h2>
        <p>
            If you want to track a habit that you only do a couple of times a week, you can choose the minimum number of days you need to complete your habit per week with the <b>Days in week</b> setting.</b>
            If you complete your streak more than the minimum number of days you specify, it still will be counted towards your streak!
        </p>
        <p>You can also customise whether your week starts on a Sunday or a Monday.</p>

    <h2>Deleting your streak</h2>
        <p>Your streak will be deleted if you delete the card that it is tracked on, or if you press the <b>Delete</b> button.
            This is an irreversible action.
        </p>
